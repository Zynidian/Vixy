Vixy is a simple NES game where you play as the titular fairy girl, collecting gems and dodging walls.

Originally a project I started around March of 2023 as a challenge to myself to make an actual complete
game on the NES (even if it is really simple). Prior to then, most of my NES projects were more proof
of concepts or tests, along with a couple test demos and games.

The game can be played in any half decent NES emulator or on real hardware using the vixy.nes ROM.

Builds using CC65/CA65
There is an included build file, but the file paths may need to be edited (the .bat file is really short)
Most of the source code is a little messy, but its not unruly by any means and is fairly well commented.
